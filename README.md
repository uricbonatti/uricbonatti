- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a frontend graduation project using GraphQL, React and TypeScript

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about tests and continuous integration (Jest/Enzime and CircleCI)

- ðŸ”­ An important fact: I'm surveying engineer, but now i 'am study system analysis and development

- ðŸ”­ Other important fact: I really love codes that follow the clean code guide, but i love a lot more programs that do what they need do

- âš¡ An stupid fact: I thing java and php are legacy in many project types because they are not efficient in data processing and data traffic, but one of my postgraduate degrees is in Java and PHP development

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm 28 year old, games, rpg and technology are my passions

- ðŸ”­ I am generally proactive, as I value excellence and team development, teaching is not a problem for me (study, understand, process, apply and teach in the simplest way possible)

- ðŸ˜„ I hate work with client, because understanding his problem and I wanna solve it.
